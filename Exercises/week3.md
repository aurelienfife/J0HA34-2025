## Week 3 — Logic & branching
**Reminder:** **LESSON** = reproduce the code. **TRY** = attempt the task without seeing the code.

1. **TRY — Correct number**
   - **Task:** Ask the user to enter a number. If it equals 3, display “that is the correct number”, otherwise display a different message.

2. **TRY — Nightclub age (≥ 18)**
   - **Task:** Ask the user for their age. If they enter 18 or above, display “You are old enough to get into nightclubs”.

3. **TRY — Two-branch nightclub check**
   - **Task:** Extend the previous task: if age ≥ 18 say they are old enough; else say they are not old enough.

4. **TRY — Daily alcohol units**
   - **Task:** Ask how many units of alcohol are consumed per day. If more than 3, output “You have exceeded your recommended daily allowance of alcohol today”. Else output “You have kept within the daily guidelines for alcohol intake”.

5. **TRY — Favourite subject (Animation/JavaScript)**
   - **Task:** Ask the user their favourite subject at college. If they answer “Animation” or “JavaScript”, display “Really, that’s my favourite too”. Otherwise suggest those subjects.

6. **TRY — Male/Female alcohol limits**
   - **Task:** Ask whether the user is male or female and how many units they have consumed today. Female: >3 exceeds allowance; ≤3 within guidelines. Male: >4 exceeds allowance; ≤4 within guidelines.

7. **TRY — Football team list**
   - **Task:** Ask for 5 footballers’ names for a team. Display a heading “Here is your team”, then list the names.

8. **TRY — Weekday by number**
   - **Task:** Using the current date, display the name of today’s weekday. 

9. **TRY — Weekend messages**
   - **Task:** Depending on the day, output one of: “Soon it is the weekend”, “It is the weekend”, or “Looking forward to the weekend”.
